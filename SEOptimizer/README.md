# SEOptimizer CLI Tool

## Overview
This is a small CLI tool I created for myself to expedite the process of converting file assets for websites into SEO friendly file types. 
I prefer to use a local offline tool for converting assets to avoid giving third party online conversion tools my files, especially personal stuff like selfies for example.
Having an offline tool also gives me the flexibility to use this tool even when working offline. I prepared .exe files for each operating system so I can keep them stored
in the cloud and bring it over to other computers whenever I need to (Or keep in a hardrive for complete offline flexibility).

## Features
- FFMpeg: A file conversion program which enables us to perform edits and conversion of various files types. 
- PyTest: A unit testing framework for running tests on file conversion functions to ensure that everything works as intended.

## Installation Instructions
1. Navigate to the executables folder in this repository and select the file for your operating system (.exe for Windows, .dmg for MacOS, .appImage for Ubuntu Linux).
2. Install it and then click on it to start the app. A terminal showing the menu should open automatically.
